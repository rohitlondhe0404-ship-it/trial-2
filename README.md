i dont know how to solve this problem

                used_pokemons.add(pokemon['id'])
                break
    return matched
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for p in pokemons:
    plt.plot(p['x'], p['y'], 'ro')  # PokÃ©mon in red
for s in shots:
    plt.plot(s['x'], s['y'], 'bo')  # Shots in blue
plt.show()
